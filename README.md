# About

I started developing Nebula because I didn't particularly enjoy the way that powershell and command prompt work.
I enjoyed developing and using Nebula, so I decided to turn it into an actual application. Nebula is, of course, free and entirely open source. I had originally started developing Nebula with python and decided to stick with as it makes it considerably easier for people to contribute to the project.

# Features

Nebula has all the standard features that you would expect with a CLI, such as:
- Standard CLI commands
- Integration with CLI tools such as Neovim, Git, etc.
